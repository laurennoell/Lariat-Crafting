# Lariat-Crafting
## A guide on how to craft your Lariat.

### Step 1: 
Gather the necessary materials. The materials that are **not** spec/class specific are:
            a) **Spark of Ingenuity** (Biweekly questline - you should have at least 1)
            b) **30 Primal Chaos** These come from outdoor activities/raid/pvp/dungeons/playing the game
            c) **Shimmering Clasps** Just buy them from the Auction House
            d) **Illimited Diamond** - AH. Probably fine to buy rank 3. 
            e) **Elemental Harmony** - Kind of expensive. Buy it from the Auction house. 
            f) Some kind of an **infusion** either primal or concentrated primal. I think go with 
             primal if you have it (drops 1 per m+11 or higher completed), if you don't its fine 
             because you can recraft them in the future without the need for an ingenuity. 

The materials that **are** class/spec specific are missives. These are exactly the same as the ones from 
shadowlands *except* both stats are combined into one material so there are 18 different types of missives 
(6 types each with 3 types of quality). It is very worth to buy a quality 3 missive in my opinion.

### How do I know which missive to buy?

Your class discord will have the information in their pins/faq page. If they don't / you don't immediately
see it, please go to warcraftlogs.com click the raids drop down menu, click rankings (under Vault of the 
Incarnates). Under "All classes" select your specialization and see what the players are using in their 
neck. For example, I clicked on Norahh under Windwalker Monk and see the neck with the picture I've posted. 
This means he has the missive with Critical Strike and Versatility Missive.

### I found what stats I want on my neck, how do I know what the missive is called?

Go to the auction house, in the search bar type Draconic MIssive scroll down to the bottom and you will 
see all of the 3 star missives (they are usually at the bottom since they are more expensive). Find the 
one that is relevant for you and click "buyout". 

### Step 2: Submitting the order

Talk to this chick with the icon above her head.

Find the neck.

Click on the neck. Go to the top right field and make sure the drop down says personal order. Type **Daranorr** in 
the "to:  " field and set the minimum quality to 3. Under *Customize Secondary Stats*, select your bought missive 
and if you are going to be using an infusion, enter that as well. Everything else should automatically be filled out.

### Very Important

Set the commission to 10,000gold. I recommend setting the duration to 48 hours just in case but it likely doesn't matter Daranorr is a gamer.

### Step 3

Click "Place Order" and wait.
