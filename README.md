# Lariat-Crafting
## A guide on how to craft your Lariat.

### Step 1: 
Gather the necessary materials. The materials that are **not** spec/class specific are:

            1. Spark of Ingenuity (Biweekly questline - you should have at least 1)
            2. 30 Primal Chaos These come from outdoor activities/raid/pvp/dungeons/playing the game
            3. Shimmering Clasps Just buy them from the Auction House
            4. Illimited Diamond - AH. If you're really strapped on cash, you can get rank 2 but if you 
            get rank 3, the neck will be rank 4 which is really nice. More words on recrafting at the end.
            5. Elemental Harmony - Buy it from the Auction house. 
            6. Some kind of an infusion either primal or concentrated primal. I think go with 
             primal if you have it (drops 1 per m+11 or higher completed), if you don't its fine 
             because you can recraft them in the future without the need for an ingenuity. 

The materials that **are** class/spec specific are missives. These are exactly the same as the ones from 
shadowlands *except* both stats are combined into one material so there are 18 different types of missives 
(6 types each with 3 types of quality). It is very worth to buy a quality 3 missive in my opinion.

### How do I know which missive to buy?

Your class discord will have the information in their pins/faq page. If they don't / you don't immediately
see it, please go to warcraftlogs.com click the raids drop down menu, click rankings (under Vault of the 
Incarnates). Under "All classes" select your specialization and see what the players are using in their 
neck. For example, I clicked on Norahh under Windwalker Monk and see the neck with the picture I've posted. 
This means he has the missive with Critical Strike and Versatility Missive.

### I found what stats I want on my neck, how do I know what the missive is called?

Go to the auction house, in the search bar type Draconic Missive scroll down to the bottom and you will 
see all of the 3 star missives (they are usually at the bottom since they are more expensive). Find the 
one that is relevant for you and click "buyout". 

### Step 2: Submitting the order

Talk to this chick with the icon above her head.

Find the neck.

Click on the neck. Go to the top right field and make sure the drop down says guild order. Under 
*Customize Secondary Stats*, select your bought missive and if you are going to be using an infusion, enter 
that as well. Everything else should automatically be filled out.

### Step 3

Click "Place Order" and wait.

### I've recieved my neck, but it only has one socket. Did I do something wrong?

No. Only jewellers can add sockets to neck which means you will need to buy items made by jewellers to make the other two 
sockets. 

Buy **two** tiered medallion settings. If you want to save gold, one should be silver quality (two star) and the other gold 
(three star). Use the **two** star one first or otherwise you will need to buy another three starred one.

### What should I put in my sockets?

There are many different types of gems in dragonflight. 

            1. Gems with one secondary stat. They offer the highest possible singular secondary stat you can get from one gem.
            2. Gems with two secondary stats. They offer the highest possible total secondary stats you can get from one gem. 
               They will all have one secondary stat which is significantly higher than the other. (Important) The type of gem
               is determined by whichever secondary stat is lower. For example, crafty alexandrite has 70 critical strike and 30
               haste. This means it is a haste type gem.
            3. Gems that have one primary stat and one secondary stat. These are generally the most powerful for any character but
               they are unique equipped and cannot be bought from the auction house but must instead be ordered from the same
               chick mentioned above. Please check the #crafting-orders channel to see if anyone can craft the gem which you are
               looking for. For example, Vaereth can make crit gems. This means he can make the gem which gives you 75 primary stat 
               66 critical strike (called Inscribed Illimited Diamond). All of these gems are called (*something*) Illimited Diamond and
               the type gem they are is determined by their secondary stat. 
            
### Okay that was a lot of information but what gems should I actually then get?    
            
This is the same step as above when you were trying to find which missive you want to buy. Ask others in the guild who play your 
class/spec, check your respective class discords or check warcraftlogs. Chances are almost everyone in your spec will be using the same stat. 
In my opinion, it is not worth simming your character because your secondary weightings will change with gear and what is good for you now wont 
be when you equip whatever new gear you get (unless you're a healer then you don't get gear). 

You want to socket **one** unique gem (that is, the one with primary stat and secondary stat) and two of the 
same types of gems of type 2 in the above list. Please make sure the unique equipped gem is the same **type** as the other gems 
(same secondary stat).    

### A word on how the lariat neck works.
            
The reason you want to socket the same *type* of gem is because it will choose from one of the socketed gems in your neck and 
give you secondary stats based on that. Multiple procs cannot happen independently of one another so it will probably always be 
better if they are the same type of gems.

### Rank 3 Illimited Diamond is too expensive, can I craft with rank 2 instead?

You can except Luke can't guaranteed the same level for your neck (so won't be rank 4). This is *okay* since at the end of the day,
you can recraft your neck. Recrafting works like this:

            1. Go back to the same chick where you can play crafting orders. On the top left, there is a button: "Place Recrafting Order". 
            2. You do not need new reagents except the shimmering clasp and elemental harmony (cheap), it saves the rest from your last craft
            including the missive, illimited diamond, your infusion of choice and spark of ingenuity. You CAN change the missive or infusion
            if you want to do so. 
            3. Everytime you recraft, the chance for getting a higher rank increases but is not guaranteed even if the crafter has the
            necessary skill to do so. 
 
If you originally used rank 2 illimited diamond but put in rank 3 of everything else, I believe it will take on average 2-3 recrafts to get rank 4
of your neck. This may be *cheaper* depending on the price of rank 3 illimited diamond. As of me writing this (12/21/2022), rank 3 illimited diamond is
40,000 gold which means even if you pay luke a 10k fee everytime for your recraft (don't have to but you can be nice), you should still come out ahead 
gold wise. It is a little more work however and you'll need to wait a little longer to get your neck.
