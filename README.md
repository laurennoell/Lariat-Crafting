# Lariat-Crafting
A guide on how to craft your Lariat.

Step 1: 
Gather the necessary materials. The materials that are NOT spec/class specific are:
            a) Spark of Ingenuity (Biweekly questline - you should have at least 1)
            b) 30 Primal Chaos. These come from outdoor activities/raid/pvp/dungeons/playing the game
            c) Shimmering Clasps. Just buy them from the Auction House
            d) Illimited Diamond - AH. Probably fine to buy rank 3. 
            e) Elemental Harmony - Kind of expensive. Buy it from the Auction house. 
            f) Some kind of an infusion either primal or concentrated primal. I think go with 
             primal if you have it (drops 1 per m+11 or higher completed), if you don't its fine 
             because you can recraft them in the future without the need for an ingenuity.
